## Fitment
Aria Gen 2 boasts superior wearability, characterized by enhanced comfort and fit, while accommodating a wider range of face morphologies. To ensure you have an optimal physical and functional fit, we’ve introduced eight size variations of the device—accounting for a number of human factors including head breadth and nose bridge variation.
