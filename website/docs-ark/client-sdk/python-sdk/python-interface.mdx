title: Python SDK with examples
---

We provide a set of example codes to demonstrate how to use the SDK interface that includes
* Authenticate device with connected PC
* Setup connection to device
* Setup device recording and download
* Setup device streaming and receiver with custom callback functions
* Send TTS to device

The examples code need to be exported using the following command
```bash
# Export examples codes
python -m aria.extract_sdk_samples --output ~/Downloads/
```

You should be able to find the examples codes in the following directory `projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2`.
```bash
ls ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2

device_auth.py
device_connect.py
device_record.py
device_streaming.py
```

In the next few pages, we provide detailed explanations for each example code.
