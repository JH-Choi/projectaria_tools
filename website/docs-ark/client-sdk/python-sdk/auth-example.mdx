Using aria.sdk_gen2 to authenticate an Aria Gen2 device to the connected PC.

## Run authentication example
```bash
python ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/device_auth.py
```

## Step-by-step walk through
1. Import Required Modules

Start by importing the necessary modules:

```python
import time
import aria.sdk_gen2 as sdk_gen2
```
aria.sdk_gen2 is the SDK for interacting with Aria Gen2 devices.


2. Set Up the Device Client

Create an instance of the device client:
```python
device_client = sdk_gen2.DeviceClient()
```
This object manages the connection and authentication process.

3. Configure the Device Client

Set up the configuration for the device client:
```python
config = sdk_gen2.DeviceClientConfig()
device_client.set_client_config(config)
```
You can specify device details (e.g., serial number) in DeviceClientConfig.
If default config is specified to set_client_config(), it will connect to the first available device connect through USB

4. Initiate Device Authentication

Prompt the user to open the Aria Companion app and accept the pairing request:
```python
print("Authenticating device. Please open the Aria app and accept the pairing request")
device_client.authenticate()
time.sleep(5)
```
The authenticate() method starts the authentication process.
The script waits 5 seconds to allow the user to respond.

5. Connect to the Device

Attempt to establish a connection:
```python
try:
   device = device_client.connect()
   print(f"Device authentication successful to device {device.connection_id()}")
except Exception:
   print("Failed to authenticate and connect to device")
   return
```
If authentication is successful, youâ€™ll see a success message with the device connection ID.

device = device_client.connect() will return a Device Class which can be used to control the device for more features such as recording, streaming, etc.
