# Introduction to ClientSDK
ClientSDK is a comprehensive toolbox designed to facilitate control and interaction with Aria Gen2 devices. It is part of the Aria Research Kit and provides a set of libraries, utilities,
and example code to streamline device management, authentication, recording and streaming.

Key Features
* Device Management: Core classes and utilities for connecting to, authenticating, and controlling Aria Gen2 devices.
* Streaming Support: Components for starting and managing data streams, including on-device machine perception data (VIO, hand pose, and eye gaze) and other sensor data.
* Recording Support: Components for starting and managing recording on-device.
* Security: Built-in support for streaming certificates and security options.
* Python & CLI Tools: Includes Python SDK and command-line utilities for scripting and automation.
* Example Code: Ready-to-use examples to help developers get started quickly.

To explore the SDK, please follow the installation guidance below.

## Install via virtual environment
### Step 1 : Install Python

To use ClientSDK, you'll need Python 3.8 - 3.12.
* [Python 3 download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* To check what what version of Python 3 you have use `python3 --version`

### Step 2 : Create a virtual environment
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="unix" label="Linux & macOS">
```bash
rm -rf $HOME/clientsdk_python_env
python3 -m venv $HOME/clientsdk_python_env
source $HOME/clientsdk_python_env/bin/activate
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

###  Step 3 : Install the required python packages

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# install projectaria-tools
pip install projectaria-tools==2.0.0
```

###  Step 4 : Install client sdk python package.
```
pip install projectaria-client-sdk==2.0.0
```

## Authenticate your device with your PC
You need to authenticate your device with your PC to allow secure connection and control. To pair your device with the PC, please first pair the device with your mobile
Companion App.
```bash
# connect device to the computer and check if the device appears
aria-gen2 device list

# Authenticate device to connect with the PC
aria-gen2 auth pair
```

You will need to approve the authentication from your mobile Companion App to allow connection as shown here.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/docs-ark/client-sdk/ca_approve.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '300px', height: 'auto' }}
/>

NOTE: You only need to do this once per device and PC.


Once authenticated, you can check your authentication status using the command below.
```bash
# check if authentication
aria-gen2 auth check
```

## CLI available controls
You can use the packaged CLI to control the device to
* Recording: control the device to start, stop, list and download recordings in VRS format.
* Streaming: control the device to start and stop streaming.
* Device: general device controls that includes obtain device information, connect to WIFI, sending text-to-speech, etc
* Player: Receives device streaming data and perform health monitoring of the streaming data regard latency and data drops.

For detailed instructions, you can refer to the Technical Specs page for more details.
