This page provides basic information about how to install the Project Aria Tools library as a Python package using `pip`.
For more advanced installation options including installing CMake / Python package from source code, please refer to the
[Advanced Installation](/docs-research-tools/projectariatools/advanced-installation.mdx) page.

## Installing `projectaria-tools` {#installing}

<InstallChooser />

Use the above table to get the exact command to install `projectaria-tools` library.
- We **strongly recommend** install `projectaria-tools` via `pip` packages within a Python virtual environment.
- `stable` represents the most currently tested and supported version of PyTorch. This should be suitable for many users; `develop` is pushed continuously to the `main` branch on Github repo.
- For users who wants to **build the library from source code (C++ or Python)**, please refer to instructions in [the advanced installation page](/docs-research-tools/projectariatools/advanced-installation.mdx).
