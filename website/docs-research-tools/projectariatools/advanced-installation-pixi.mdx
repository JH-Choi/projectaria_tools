# Build projectaria_tools in isolation with Pixi

You can build `projectaria_tools` in isolation using pixi on and for your local platform (Linux, macOS Intel/Silicon) using the exact same command lines.
Pixi is a convenient package and environment manager that simplifies the logic to compile and run projects by defining dependencies and tasks in a single pixi.toml file for all platforms.

:::note
Aria-Gen2 support is not yet available for Windows users.

### Step 1: Install Pixi

```bash
# Install Pixi
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

### Step 2: Compile and test the code

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

  ```bash
  # When this command line first run, it will collect required dependencies, and then trigger the build and unit test
  pixi run run_c
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

  ```bash
  # When this command line first run, it will collect required dependencies, and then trigger the build and unit test
  pixi run run_python
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Access the compiled artifacts in C++

```bash
# Activate the environment
pixi shell

# You can now run and use things from the projects.

# For example, with Python, you can import the projectaria_tools package and use it.
python
import projectaria_tools
dir(projectaria_tools)
# Will print
>>>['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__path__', '__spec__', 'core']
```
